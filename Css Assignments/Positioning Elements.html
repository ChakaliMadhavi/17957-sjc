    <h1>Franz Kafka</h1>
    <button style="position: fixed;">Early life</button>



    <P>Franz Kafka, a towering figure in literature, is renowned for his exploration of existential themes, bureaucratic
        nightmares, and the alienation of modern life. Born in Prague in 1883 to a middle-class Jewish family, Kafka's
        works
        delve into the absurdity and surrealism of the human condition, resonating with readers worldwide long after his
        death in 1924.

        Kafka's writing style is characterized by its precision, lucidity, and meticulous attention to detail. His prose
        often navigates the labyrinthine complexities of the human psyche, plunging readers into a world of labyrinthine
        bureaucracy, nightmarish scenarios, and existential angst. Through his works, such as "The Metamorphosis," "The
        Trial," and "The Castle," Kafka explores themes of alienation, guilt, and the search for meaning in a world
        governed
        by opaque forces beyond human comprehension.</P>
    <button style="position: fixed;">Literary activities</button>

    <div>Central to Kafka's oeuvre is the motif of the individual grappling with insurmountable external forces, be they
        societal expectations, oppressive institutions, or existential dread. In "The Metamorphosis," the protagonist
        wakes
        up to find himself transformed into a giant insect, serving as a metaphor for his profound sense of estrangement
        from society and self. Similarly, "The Trial" follows the protagonist Josef K. as he navigates a labyrinthine
        legal
        system that operates with arbitrary and inscrutable logic, highlighting themes of powerlessness and the
        absurdity of
        human existence.

        Kafka's works have inspired countless interpretations and adaptations, transcending cultural and linguistic
        boundaries. His exploration of the human condition continues to resonate with readers, scholars, and artists
        alike,
        cementing his status as one of the most influential literary figures of the 20th century. Kafka's legacy endures
        as
        a testament to the power of literature to illuminate the darkest recesses of the human soul and provoke
        introspection on the nature of existence itself.</div>
